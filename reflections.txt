>> How does your gem take advantage of Rubyâ€™s metaprogramming capabilities?

creating methods from array items - no need to create it manually for each item
so our code is DRY
adding a new method is so easy - just add new item in an array (name: color_code)

>> How long did you spend working on this project? 
about 3.5hr

>> What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered? 
Well i've lost like 40 minutes because I didnt add self. before method name and somehow
I didn't know that I need to build gem again each time I update its code. It was very frustrating
but now I won't forget it :P

Metaprogramming is really interesting as a junior php developer I had situations that would make it very
useful (like creating function with given dynamic name) but I didn't know it is possible.
Unfortunatelly you need to implement it in php yourself, ive just found some snippet ->
https://gist.github.com/CHH/1180947 and I'm really happy now that I decided to learn Ruby and
possibly switch to it :D

>> Where do you still have room to grow?
I just brushed up on Metaprogramming a little bit. It still feels a little bit overwhelming.
Guess I need to just play around it.
